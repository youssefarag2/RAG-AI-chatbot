# RAG - Question Answering Application

This is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application designed for question answering. The app leverages a combination of retrieval-based methods and generative models to answer questions based on a given dataset.

Currently, the project is a work in progress, and some features are still being developed and fine-tuned. Stay tuned for future updates as we continue to enhance the functionality and performance of the application!
